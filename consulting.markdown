# Agile Consulting

Some of the areas I help organizations with in Agile are as below. <br>

***
###  Agile Maturity Assessments
<p> Assessment of Organization and Teams is essential to know present state of Agile adoption and to provide an insight into the gaps/challenges faced by Agile teams. The key is to understand the foundational issues faced by teams in Agile and provide remedies that are sustainable and effective. Such assessment needs to be done both at Organization level as well as Teams to identify the cultural and technological gaps that exists within groups. </p>
##### Assessment Method
- Conduct a **discovery exercise** to know AS-IS state of Agile adoption
- Interview Leadership and Teams to understand challenges & cultural aspects
- Assess teams maturity on **Agile practices, Product Ownership, Collaboration, Technical Expertise** with 20+ parameters in each area.
- Provide a comprehensive report on current state and recommendations
- Actively engage with Leadership to **Define a future roadmap and strategy**
- Help **Identify Pilot**, restructure teams if required and provide trainings
