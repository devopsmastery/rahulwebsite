<p>My Name is Rahul Gujar and Im from city of Pune in India.</p>

### Background
With more than <strong> 20+ Years in the IT industry </strong> in varying roles, Im now working as an independent <strong>Consultant in Agile and DevOps.</strong>

After spending few years in US and UK, i finally decided to move back to India after the birth of my son in 2007. Since then, I have been into various lead roles and led teams on software project deliveries with Agile. It was kind of a fortunate and natural transition for me in Agile space as I was assigned on a program with British Telecom which were into Agile since 2005.

I also had the privilege of working with a telecom products & services company- <strong> Tata Communications - where as a Senior Tech Manager </strong> where I was given the opportunity to establish <strong> Agile Practice </strong>. We gradually transformed from 1 agile team (using Scrum) to multiple Agile teams using scaling methods of SAFe. All this took a good 2-3 years between 2015 to 2018 to materialize the benefits of agile. Also, working on niche products having global reach provided me with the right kind of technical exposure on <strong> DevOps and Cloud (AWS) </strong> added with the faster deliveries with Agile.

So I think I have the right blend of process and technical know-how and with that at the foundations, I decided to change tracks in my career and move on to do <strong> Consulting and IT Training </strong> under my flagship company - Tech Tutor.

Since 2018, I have done few consulting assignments in Dubai with a bank on Agile transformation and as an Agile Consultant with one of the leading Healthcare Products based company in US.

I also feel teaching is twice learning and whenever I get a chance, I do trainings - few of those are listed below. I have more than <strong>5000+ Hours of training hours and delivered trainings in India, Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, Dubai, Germany, Qatar, Indonesia and Sri Lanka across various clients<strong> <br>

### Personal Front
<p>Im married and my wife works in IT and we are blessed with a loving son who is in his teens. During my free time, I like reading books on management and autobiographies (they are just so inspiring) and play Badminton with a bunch of enthusiasts each morning which just switches on the competitive sprit and sets the tone for rest of the day. </p>
