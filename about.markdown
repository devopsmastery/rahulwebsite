<p>My Name is Rahul Gujar and Im from city of Pune in India.</p>

### Background
With more than **20+ Years in the IT industry** in varying roles, I'm now working as a **Agile and DevOps Consultant**

After spending few years in US and UK, I finally decided to move back to India after the birth of my son in 2007. Since then, I have been into various lead roles and led teams on software project deliveries with Agile. It was kind of a fortunate and natural transition for me in Agile space as I was assigned on a program with British Telecom which were into Agile since 2005.

I also had the privilege of working with a telecom products & services company- **Tata Communications - as a Senior Tech Manager** where I was given the opportunity to establish <strong> Agile Practice </strong> in Telepresence Engineering group which entailed setting up guidelines for Agile Teams, Defining Roles & Responsibilities, Provide appropriate trainings and set practices that builds the culture of Transparency and Collaboration. <br>

The transformation journey itself was a long one where we transformed from 1 agile team (using Scrum) to multiple Agile teams using scaling methods of SAFe. All this took a good 2-3 years between 2015 to 2018 to materialize and reap the benefits of agile.<br>

Also, working on niche products having global reach provided me with the right kind of technical exposure on **DevOps and Cloud (AWS)** added with the faster deliveries with Agile. <br>

So with the right blend of process and technical know-how at the foundations, I decided to change tracks in my career and move on to do **Consulting and IT Training** in 2018 and have been assisting organizations as Agile & DevOps Consultant.<br>

I have done few consulting assignments in Dubai with a bank on Agile transformation and as an Agile Consultant with one of the leading Healthcare Products based company in US. <br>

I also feel teaching is twice learning and whenever I get a chance, I do trainings - few of those are listed below. I have more than **2000+ training hours and delivered trainings in India, Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, Dubai, Germany, Qatar, Indonesia and Sri Lanka across various clients over the past 4 years** <br>

### Personal Front
<p>I'm married and my wife works in IT. We are blessed with a loving son who is in his teens. During my free time, I like reading books on management and autobiographies (they are just so inspiring) and play Badminton with a bunch of enthusiasts each morning which just switches on the competitive spirit and sets the tone for rest of the day. </p>
